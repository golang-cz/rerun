rerun: re-run command on file system changes
============================================

Credit for this library goes to https://github.com/VojtechVitek/rerun

Lightweight file-watcher that re-runs given command on FS changes. It has simple CLI and optional config file. By default, it uses 200ms delay, which gives enough time for tools like git to update all directories/files within repository before killing the old process (when you switch branches etc).

# Usage

```
rerun                                run all rerun.yml targets in parallel
rerun <target> [target...]           start these rerun.yml targets; the TUI
                                     still lists every target, space starts one
rerun -- <cmd>                       ad-hoc run: watch ./ and run <cmd>
rerun a b --except c d -- <cmd>      bare words = watchlist, --except = ignorelist
rerun --on a b --except c d -- <cmd> --on is an explicit watchlist keyword
```

Everything after `--` is the command, passed through verbatim.

Naming targets picks what starts, not what is listed: the TUI still shows
every rerun.yml target. The named ones come up running; the rest start off
and `space` starts one by hand.

Target mode on a terminal opens a TUI: one row per target, `?` lists the keys.
Piped or non-TTY output stays plain prefixed lines.

Keys: `j/k` move the cursor, `space` start/stop, `r` reboot, `m` mute a
stream, `s` or `enter` solo (`esc` clears), `o` open the url, `G` live output.
Mouse: click a row to select it, its button cell to mute, shift-click or
double-click to solo. The right pane is always the merged stream; soloing
narrows it to one target and drops the `[name]` prefixes.

#### Examples:
```bash
# Ad-hoc: watch ./ and re-run the command on any change
$ rerun -- go test ./...

# Explicit watch and ignore lists
$ rerun '**/*.go' --except vendor -- go build ./...

# Named targets from rerun.yml
$ rerun
$ rerun frontend api

# Watchlist from stdin, when it is not a TTY
$ find . -name '*.go' | rerun -- go test ./...
```

#### Flags:
```
-delay <dur>      batch window before restarting a command (default 200ms)
-cooldown <dur>   minimum time between restarts (default 0s)
-grace <dur>      time between SIGTERM and SIGKILL (default 5s)
-no-gitignore     do not filter watched files through .gitignore
-h, -help         show this help
-version          show version
```

Flags override the matching fields of rerun.yml targets, e.g.
`rerun api -delay 1s`.

#### Deprecated: `-watch`, `-ignore` and `-run`
They still work in this major version. Prefer `--on`, `--except` and `--`.

# rerun.yml

Place a `rerun.yml` anywhere in the repo. rerun walks up from the current
directory, stopping at the git root, and takes the first one it finds.

```yaml
frontend:
  desc: Vite dev server
  on: web
  except: [node_modules, dist]
  cmd: pnpm run dev
  delay: 250ms
  cooldown: 2s
  grace: 1s

api:
  on: [cmd, internal]
  except: vendor
  cmd: go run ./cmd/api
```

Each top-level key is one target. Fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `desc` | free-form description |
| `on` | watch paths or globs, a string or a list |
| `except` | paths or globs to ignore, a string or a list |
| `cmd` | shell command to run, required |
| `url` | url to open for the target (`o`, and `open: true` at startup) |
| `open` | open `url` in the browser once at startup (default false) |
| `selected` | start this target on a bare `rerun` (default true); naming a target on the command line overrides it either way |
| `delay` | batch window before restarting (default 200ms) |
| `cooldown` | minimum time between restarts (default 0s) |
| `grace` | time between SIGTERM and SIGKILL (default 5s) |

# Installation

```bash
go install github.com/golang-cz/rerun/cmd/rerun@latest
```
*You might need to [download Go](https://golang.org/dl/) first.*

Uses [fsnotify](https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify) behind the scenes, so technically it should work on most platforms including Linux, Mac OS and Windows.
